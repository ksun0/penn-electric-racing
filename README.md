# Kevin Y. Sun - Software Design Challenge
During this software design, I learned how to parse csv files and lots of Python list comprehension. In the second problem, I learned about bytes, bits, converting to hexadecimal and floats, etc. I was able to integrate with rectangles (Reinman sums i think?) and relearn basic Physics formulas. Most of my algorithms are O(n), looping through the lines of the file once, but I may have some nested loops in there.

*Note: A lot of my code is messy and uncommented due to lack of time sorry! :(*

## How to Run Code
1.  Install jupyter
2. Run `jupyer notebook` in terminal folder containing the notebooks
3. View the outputs of the cells or restart/rerun cells

## Results
1. Max speed: 65.26362 mph, min: 0.0, average: 20.241668003988906, total energy consumed: 1.9924271932654989
2.  Total energy consumed: 4.663028381891487 Speeds: Didn't have time, but do similar stuff except with angular velocity this time (convert to miles per rotation, etc.)
